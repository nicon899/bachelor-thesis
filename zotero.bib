It contains more than 20 predefined machine learning algorithms. With Azure ML Studio, it is possible to import data from different resources, devise machine learning experiments, and create a web service from the model. Moreover, it is possible to run the R or Python codes inside the Azure ML Studio environment. In this chapter, first I will explain the environment and how to formulate an experiment in it, how to create a simple machine learning model, how to test and evaluate the model, and how to import data from the local machine from other Azure components. Also, I will discuss the process of creating a web service from the model. The process of how to run R codes inside the Azure ML Studio will be explored. In addition, the process of exploring an Azure ML experiment in R Studio will be elaborated.},

	abstract = {The first mention of Azure SQL, referred to as “Microsoft SQL Services” at the time, was when Microsoft announced “Project Red Dog” (Microsoft Azure) at Microsoft’s Professional Developer Conference (PDC) in 2008. This cloud-hosted version of SQL Server was one of the first services available on Azure. From the beginning, it was meant to provide a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering of SQL Server, where you don’t have to provision hardware or patch software and you can enjoy benefits that come with running in the cloud – availability, performance, security, and scale – without deploying complex and expensive systems on premises. Since then, Azure SQL has continued to grow and evolve with the Azure platform. As you read this book, it’s important to remember that things are always changing. While some of the “little rocks” or details throughout the book may change slightly as the platform evolves, the “big rocks” you will learn in this book will provide a solid foundation for you to grow in the space of developing with databases.},

You'll learn how to architect solutions such as serverless functions, you'll discover deployment patterns for containers and Kubernetes, and you'll explore large-scale big data processing using Spark and Databricks. As you advance, you'll implement DevOps using Azure DevOps, work with intelligent solutions using Azure Cognitive Services, and integrate security, high availability, and scalability into each solution. Finally, you'll delve into Azure security concepts such as OAuth, OpenConnect, and managed identities. By the end of this book, you'll have gained the confidence to design intelligent Azure solutions based on containers and serverless functions.},

	abstract = {In days gone by, a data warehouse stood as a slow-moving, often large, unwieldly part of a wider decision support system. While tools and technologies that feed to or read from the data warehouse may develop, the complexity of such an artifact and the investment in its development mean that the warehouse would rarely benefit from such upgrades. Throughout this book, I have explained and demonstrated the highlights of building a modern data warehouse in Azure – one which can be developed rapidly and be highly flexible to source system requirements, one which can move and develop with the times and not cause sleepless nights worrying over the SQL version going out of support, one which can ingest in batch-, stream-, or event-based modes offering ultimate speed and time to insight. The focus of this final chapter is now to look at what sits beyond the modern data warehouse. There is a wealth of BI products in the market that provide a range of capabilities and visualizations to the end user, and it can be very difficult to choose between them without a thorough review. This chapter is not a thorough review of BI products but instead give examples of downstream options for warehouse data. Initially this chapter will look at Power BI, as that is the de facto visualization tool for any data but will also examine some other Microsoft products for data as it leaves the data warehouse such as Azure Analysis Services and Azure Cosmos DB.},

Then we will explain why you need a comprehensive strategy for debugging and profiling in Azure, as well as the basics of what that entails. Throughout the chapters, we will use a fictitious company to illustrate different scenarios, and in this chapter, we will introduce the company, its business objectives, and how we will use Azure to achieve them. The goal of this chapter is to provide a high-level view of development on Azure, as well as to set the tone of the book, in explaining an introductory perspective on debugging and profiling.},

	abstract = {Business Intelligence systems use information technology to supply integrated management support with data coming from several sources of structured and unstructured data. The integrated infrastructures of Business Intelligence (BI) are often too complex and hence costly and inflexible. A solution for these issues is to leverage cloud computing services to enhance legacy BI systems and applications with cost-efficient increased scalability and flexibility. However, the migration of BI systems to cloud environments is usually hindered by strict requirements regarding privacy, security, or availability and a multitude of interdependences with other systems. In this paper, we describe the challenges in the adoption of BI within cloud environments and propose a cloud migration framework to assist decision makers in taking into account the consequences of the migration of BI systems to cloud environments as well as the impact of privacy, security, cost, and performance in so doing.},
