	abstract = {In days gone by, a data warehouse stood as a slow-moving, often large, unwieldly part of a wider decision support system. While tools and technologies that feed to or read from the data warehouse may develop, the complexity of such an artifact and the investment in its development mean that the warehouse would rarely benefit from such upgrades. Throughout this book, I have explained and demonstrated the highlights of building a modern data warehouse in Azure – one which can be developed rapidly and be highly flexible to source system requirements, one which can move and develop with the times and not cause sleepless nights worrying over the SQL version going out of support, one which can ingest in batch-, stream-, or event-based modes offering ultimate speed and time to insight. The focus of this final chapter is now to look at what sits beyond the modern data warehouse. There is a wealth of BI products in the market that provide a range of capabilities and visualizations to the end user, and it can be very difficult to choose between them without a thorough review. This chapter is not a thorough review of BI products but instead give examples of downstream options for warehouse data. Initially this chapter will look at Power BI, as that is the de facto visualization tool for any data but will also examine some other Microsoft products for data as it leaves the data warehouse such as Azure Analysis Services and Azure Cosmos DB.},

This dominance was made possible in part by the wide range of solutions that can be built on top of those systems but also because of the powerful products that are available. There is, however, a different approach to data management, commonly known as NoSQL. The term NoSQL stands for “non SQL” or “not only SQL” since SQL (Structured Query Language) is almost exclusively tied to relational systems. NoSQL databases have existed since the 1960s but it wasn’t until the early 2000s that they gained a lot of popularity with companies like Facebook and Amazon implementing them and products such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis becoming the choices for many developers.},

The integrated infrastructures of Business Intelligence (BI) are often too complex and hence costly and inflexible. A solution for these issues is to leverage cloud computing services to enhance legacy BI systems and applications with cost-efficient increased scalability and flexibility. However, the migration of BI systems to cloud environments is usually hindered by strict requirements regarding privacy, security, or availability and a multitude of interdependences with other systems. In this paper, we describe the challenges in the adoption of BI within cloud environments and propose a cloud migration framework to assist decision makers in taking into account the consequences of the migration of BI systems to cloud environments as well as the impact of privacy, security, cost, and performance in so doing.},
