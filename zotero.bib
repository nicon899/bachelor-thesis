	abstract = {The database space has been greatly dominated by relational database management systems (or RDBMSs) such as Microsoft® SQL Server or Oracle. This dominance was made possible in part by the wide range of solutions that can be built on top of those systems but also because of the powerful products that are available. There is, however, a different approach to data management, commonly known as NoSQL. The term NoSQL stands for “non SQL” or “not only SQL” since SQL (Structured Query Language) is almost exclusively tied to relational systems. NoSQL databases have existed since the 1960s but it wasn’t until the early 2000s that they gained a lot of popularity with companies like Facebook and Amazon implementing them and products such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis becoming the choices for many developers.},

It introduces you to different terms that will be explored further as we explain their blades in the Azure portal, including Function as a Service (FaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Then we will explain why you need a comprehensive strategy for debugging and profiling in Azure, as well as the basics of what that entails. Throughout the chapters, we will use a fictitious company to illustrate different scenarios, and in this chapter, we will introduce the company, its business objectives, and how we will use Azure to achieve them. The goal of this chapter is to provide a high-level view of development on Azure, as well as to set the tone of the book, in explaining an introductory perspective on debugging and profiling.},

	abstract = {Business Intelligence systems use information technology to supply integrated management support with data coming from several sources of structured and unstructured data. The integrated infrastructures of Business Intelligence (BI) are often too complex and hence costly and inflexible. A solution for these issues is to leverage cloud computing services to enhance legacy BI systems and applications with cost-efficient increased scalability and flexibility. However, the migration of BI systems to cloud environments is usually hindered by strict requirements regarding privacy, security, or availability and a multitude of interdependences with other systems. In this paper, we describe the challenges in the adoption of BI within cloud environments and propose a cloud migration framework to assist decision makers in taking into account the consequences of the migration of BI systems to cloud environments as well as the impact of privacy, security, cost, and performance in so doing.},
