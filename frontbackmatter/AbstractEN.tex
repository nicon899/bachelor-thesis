	\chapter*{Abstract}
This paper addresses the question of how an on-premise BI system consisting of applications for data integration, storage and reporting can be migrated to the Azure Cloud. For this purpose, a cloud BI architecture is designed that covers all required functionalities and is as cost-effective as possible. To achieve this, various Azure services are evaluated in relation to a requirements specification and selected based on the results. To ensure that the requirements for security and data protection are satisfied, the architecture is supplemented with services suitable for this purpose. To prove that the cloud BI concept works in practice, the new BI architecture is implemented as a prototype. The implementation considers how a migration can be carried out with as little effort as possible.  A final evaluation of the test cases shows that the prototype meets more requirements than the existing system. On this basis, it will be discussed when the migration from on-premise to cloud BI is advisable and what should be considered in the process. \end{otherlanguage}
