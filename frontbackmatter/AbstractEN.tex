	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Business Intelligence (BI) is used in companies to analyze and visualize data. The BI system considered here consists of a relational data warehouse, OLAP cubes, data marts and reports based on a web framework. In the future, this system is expected to be replaced by a modern BI solution in the Azure Cloud. There are many architectural options with different advantages and disadvantages. This raises the question of how a cloud BI system should be designed so that it can cover the desired functionality as cost-effectively as possible while at the same time satisfying security and data protection requirements. To answer this question, several services of the Azure Cloud are evaluated. Based on the evaluation results, a complete concept for a new BI architecture is designed. The new concept will be implemented as a prototype on which different use cases can be tested. This ensures that the requirements are satisfied in practice and that potential problems are identified at an early stage. Finally, it is discussed whether the migration from on-premise to cloud BI is actually worth it and what should be considered in the process.
