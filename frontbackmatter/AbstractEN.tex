	\chapter*{Abstract}
This paper addresses the question of how an on-premise BI-system, which consists of applications for data integration, storage and reporting, can be migrated to the Azure Cloud. For this purpose, a cloud BI architecture is designed that covers all required functionalities as cost-effectively as possible. For this purpose, various Azure services are evaluated in terms of a requirements specification, selected based on the results, and supplemented with additional services to meet security and data protection requirements.
The new BI architecture is implemented as a prototype that demonstrates that the cloud BI concept works in practice. The implementation will cover how a migration could be carried out with as little effort as possible. A final evaluation of the test cases shows that the prototype meets more requirements than the existing system. On this basis, it is discussed when the migration from on-premise to cloud BI is worthwhile and what should be considered in the process. \end{otherlanguage}
